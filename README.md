# Boot-Loader
This is a Boot Loader I built to for my OS.

This for a higher Understanding of how OS works and How to take the advantages of it's vulnerabilties and Learn something new.
The Bootloader was actually made by "https://github.com/jophish" and taking him as my mentor I am going to make it a Good Learning streak and utilize it for my betterment...
